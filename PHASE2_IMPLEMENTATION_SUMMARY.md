### **Backend Enhancements (`backend/routes/ai-chat.js`)**
```javascript
// New predictive analytics function
function calculatePredictiveInsights(trendMetrics, monthlyData, properties, currentMonth)

// Revenue forecasting with trend projection
if (trendMetrics.revenueTrend === 'increasing') {
    const growthRate = 0.15; // 15% growth assumption
    revenueForecast.nextMonth = Math.round(avgRecentRevenue * (1 + growthRate));
}

// Occupancy forecasting with seasonal patterns
if (trendMetrics.seasonalPattern === 'summer_peak') {
    occupancyForecast.peakSeason = { months: 'Dec-Feb', rate: Math.min(100, Math.round(currentOccupancy * 1.4)) };
}
```

### **Frontend Enhancements (`web/js/ai-chat.js`)**
```javascript
