-- Enable RLS on profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own profile" ON profiles;

-- Create policies for authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile" ON profiles
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = id);
