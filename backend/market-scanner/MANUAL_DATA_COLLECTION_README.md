### 9. Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **Price not showing**: Check if it's "POA" (Price on Application)
- **Bedroom count unclear**: Look for "2 bedroom" in title/description
- **Size not listed**: Can often be estimated or left blank
- **Contact info missing**: Note "Agent not specified"

**Data Validation:**
- Prices should be realistic for Sea Point (R15k-R100k+)
- Bedroom counts should match property size
- Addresses should be in Sea Point area
