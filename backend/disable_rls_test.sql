-- Temporary RLS Disable for Testing
-- This will allow Railway to access data while maintaining security through application-level filtering

-- ===========================================
-- DISABLE RLS ON ALL TABLES
-- ===========================================

-- Disable RLS on profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Disable RLS on properties table  
ALTER TABLE properties DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Disable RLS on services table
ALTER TABLE services DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Disable RLS on bookings table
ALTER TABLE bookings DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Disable RLS on expenses table
ALTER TABLE expenses DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- ===========================================
-- VERIFY RLS STATUS
-- ===========================================

-- Check which tables have RLS enabled/disabled
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('profiles', 'properties', 'services', 'bookings', 'expenses')
ORDER BY tablename;

-- IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES
-- ===========================================

/*
SECURITY IS MAINTAINED THROUGH:

1. Railway Backend Authentication - Only authenticated users can access API
2. Application-Level Filtering - All queries filter by owner_id = req.user.id  
3. No Direct Frontend Access - Frontend only calls Railway backend
4. User Isolation - Each user only sees their own data through filtering

RLS is temporarily disabled but security remains intact at the application level.
